## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 

 Although the pacing during the first half of the program was accelerated, it gave us the opportunity to learn so many new skills and tools that made developing the capstone project possible. For future instances, exchanging some of the spent on meetings to provide interns more work time would benefit interns by providing more time to practice with the learned topics and prevent burnouts

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

  Our plan changed in terms of the amount of features we were deciding to include in the "final" product; Although the current website contains the core functionality we wanted it to have, we would have liked to implement more features. That said, planning is definitely a development phase that must be prioritized in order to avoid facing abrupt changes that delay the project's overall progress.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?

  The daily labs and weekly assignments definitely provided us with the tools and skills needed to develop our capstone project. By covering PERN, we were left to only research any other external library or api we may want to implement in our personalized websites.

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

  We believe our mentors played a main role in the planning phase of our project. Not only they provided feedback to our ideas but also introduced concepts that really enhanced our website overall; Our capstone project would have not been the same without their support.
